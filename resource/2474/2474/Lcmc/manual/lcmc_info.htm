<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>1. Aims</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"> The corpus approach is increasingly 
  being recognized as a useful tool for linguistic investigation. However, in-depth 
  monolinguistic studies of Chinese have proved difficult in the past, because 
  of the general lack of publicly available balanced corpora. Indeed, most of 
  the existing resources relating to Chinese (e.g. the <a href="ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/chinese/">PH 
  Corpus</a>, the <a href="http://icl.pku.edu.cn/Introduction/corpustagging.htm"> 
  PFR People’s Daily Corpus</a> released by the Institute of Computational Linguistics, 
  Peking University, and the corpora released by the LDC) are composed exclusively 
  of newswire texts or newswire texts and official documents. Balanced corpora 
  do exist, but they, too, are problematic. The <a href="http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/mkiwi.sh?language=1">Sinica 
  Corpus</a>, for example, represents the language used in Taiwan, and is therefore 
  not representive of modern Mandarin Chinese as written on the mainland of China. 
  Another corpus that does represent mainland Chinese (see Zhou &amp; Yu 1997) 
  is not publicly available. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The LCMC corpus seeks to enable 
  in-depth monolinguistic studies by making a diverse range of text-types publicly 
  available to academic researchers. LCMC, in combination with FLOB, also provides 
  a sound basis for contrastive studies of Chinese and English, whether one wishes 
  to compare the two languages as a whole or compare them by text type. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>2. Sampling frame and text
collection</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the LCMC corpus, the FLOB sampling 
  frame is followed strictly except for two minor variations. The first variation 
  relates to the sampling frame – we replaced <i>western and adventure fiction</i> 
  (category N) with <i>martial arts fiction</i>. There are three reasons for this 
  decision. Firstly, there is simply no western fiction in China; secondly, martial 
  arts fiction is a type of adventure fiction that, in China especially, is both 
  popular and important, and therefore should be represented; thirdly, the language 
  used in martial arts fiction is a distinctive language type, and thus worthy 
  of study in its own right. Most stories of this type, even though they were 
  published recently, are under the influence of vernacular Chinese, i.e. modern 
  Chinese styled to appear like classical Chinese. While the inclusion of this 
  text type has made the tasks of POS tagging and post-editing more difficult, 
  it may also make it possible to compare representations of vernacular Chinese 
  and modern Chinese. The second variation relates to our decision to modify the 
  FLOB sampling period slightly by including samples within ±2 years of 1991 when 
  an insufficient number of texts for a given category were produced in 1991 (we 
  assume that such a time span will not influence a language significantly). Texts 
  produced within ±2 years of 1991 represent no more than one third of the 500 
  samples included in the LCMC corpus. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The LCMC corpus has been
constructed using written Mandarin Chinese texts published in Mainland China to
ensure some degree of textual homogeneity. It should be noted that plain written
texts alone have been transcribed, with tables, illustrations, pictures,
formulae and special symbols omitted and replaced with a gap element marked by
the wording ‘omission’. Long citations from translated texts or texts
produced outside the sampling period were also omitted so that the effect of
translationese could be excluded and L1 quality guaranteed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A small number of samples that 
  were conformant with our sampling frame were collected from the Internet. Most 
  samples, however, were provided by the <a href="http://www.ssreader.com">SSReader 
  Digital Library</a> in China. As each page of electronic books in the library 
  comes in PDG format, these pages were transferred into text files using an OCR 
  program provided by the digital library. This scanning process resulted in a 
  1-3% error rate, depending on the quality of the picture files. Each electronic 
  text file was proofread and corrected independently by two native speakers of 
  Mandarin Chinese so as to keep the transcribed raw texts as accurate as possible.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">While the digital library has a
very large collection of books, it does not provide newspapers. The only sources
of newswire texts from the library are a dozen of collections of news awarded at
various levels. These collections, however, represent newswire texts from more
than eighty newspapers and television or broadcasting stations. The samples from
these sources account for around two thirds of texts for the press categories
(A-C). The other one third are sampled from newswire texts from Xinhua News
Agency (excerpted from the PH Corpus). Considering that this is the most
important and representative news provider in China, we believe that this
proportion is justified.<o:p>

AR-SA">Unlike western languages such as English, in which words are typically
separated with white spaces and can thus be relatively easily be counted in
terms of word number, Chinese contains running characters. Consequently, while
it is easy to count the character number, it is not possible to count word
number with raw texts. As the proofreading of raw electronic texts is
time-consuming and expensive, it was economical to proofread an excessively
large sample but use only around 2,000 words. Based on a pilot study of the
ratio of words to characters, we decided to adopt a ratio of 1:1.6, which means
that we needed a 3,200-character running text for a 2,000-word sample. When a
text was less than the required length, texts of similar quality were combined
into one sample. For longer samples, e.g. those from books, we adopted a random
procedure so that beginning, middle and ending samples have been included in all
categories. When the texts were segmented and it was possible to count exact
word numbers, they were automatically cut to around 2000 words while keeping the
final sentence complete. However, while the ratio that we decided on worked on
most texts, a small number of texts finally yielded slightly less than 2,000
words. In this case, the whole processed text was included. While some
individual samples contain fewer words, and some more words, than 2,000, the
total number of words for each text type is roughly conformant to our sampling
frame.</span>
<p><b>3. Encoding and markup conventions</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Unlike single-byte western
languages like English, Chinese uses 2 bytes of ASCII codes for each character.
Currently there are three encoding systems for Chinese characters: GB2312 for
simplified Chinese, Big5 for traditional Chinese, and Unicode. While the
original texts were encoded in GB2312, we decided to convert the encoding into
Unicode (UTF-8) for the following reasons, namely, (1) to ensure the
compatibility of non-Chinese operating system and Chinese characters; and (2) to
take advantage of the latest Unicode-compatible concordancers like <i> Xara</i> version
1.0 and the <i> WordSmith Tools </i> version 4.0.<o:p>

convenient for users with an operating system earlier than Windows 2000 and
without a language support pack to use our data, we have produced a Pinyin
version of the LCMC corpus in addition to the standard version containing
characters. While also encoded using UTF-8, the Pinyin version will be more
compatible with older operating and concordance systems. This is also of
assistance to users who can read Romanised Chinese but not Chinese characters.<o:p>

details: (1) text category, (2) file identifier, (3) paragraph, (4) sentence and
(5) word, punctuation/symbol and elements omitted in transcriptions (see <a href="LCMC_KOD.htm">List
of codes</a>). These details are useful. Presently <i> Xara</i> version 1.0 is aware of
XML markup. With this tool, users can either search the whole corpus or define a
subcorpus containing a certain text type or a specific file. The POS tags allow
users to search for a certain class of words, and in combination with tokens, to
extract a specific word that belongs to a certain class.</span>
